/**
 * 13.21 (Algebra: vertex form equations) The equation of a parabola can be expressed
 * in either standard form (y = ax2 + bx + c) or vertex form (y = a(x - h)2 + k).
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a, b, and c as integers in standard
 * form and displays h and k in the vertex form. Here are some sample runs.
 * Enter a, b, c: 1 3 1
 * h is -3/2 k is -5/4
 * Enter a, b, c: 2 3 4
 * h is -3/4 k is 23/8
