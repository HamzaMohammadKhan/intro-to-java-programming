 * **3.27 (Geometry: points in triangle?) Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as
 * shown below. The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points
 * are placed at (200, 0), and (0, 100).
 * <p>
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the
 * triangle.
 * <p>
 * Here are the sample runs:
 * <p>
 * (0, 100)
 * (0, 0) (200, 0)
 * p2
 * p1
 * Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates: 100.5 25.5
 * The point is in the triangle
