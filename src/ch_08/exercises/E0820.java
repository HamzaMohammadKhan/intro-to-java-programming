***8.20 (Game: connect four) Connect four is a two-player board game in which the
players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, six-row vertically
suspended grid, as shown below.
The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column, or a diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. The program prompts
two players to drop a red or yellow disk alternately. In the preceding figure, the
red disk is shown in a dark color and the yellow in a light color. Whenever a disk
is dropped, the program redisplays the board on the console and determines the
status of the game (win, draw, or continue). Here is a sample run:
