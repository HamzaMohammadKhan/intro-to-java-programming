/**
 * ***8.9 (Game: play a tic-tac-toe game) In a game of tic-tac-toe, two players
 * take turns marking an available cell in a 3 * 3 grid with their respective
 * tokens (either X or O). When one player has placed three tokens in a
 * horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that
 * player has won. A draw (no winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have
 * been filled with tokens and neither player has achieved a win. Create a
 * program for playing tic-tac-toe. The program prompts two players to enter an
 * X token and O token alternately. Whenever a token is entered, the program
 * redisplays the board on the console and determines the status of the game
 * (win, draw, or continue). Here is a sample run:
