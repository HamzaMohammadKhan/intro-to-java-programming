 * *8.25 (Markov matrix) An n * n matrix is called a positive Markov matrix if each
 * element is positive and the sum of the elements in each column is 1. Write the
 * following method to check whether a matrix is a Markov matrix.
 * public static boolean isMarkovMatrix(double[][] m)
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a 3 * 3 matrix of double
 * values and tests whether it is a Markov matrix. Here are sample runs:
 * Enter a 3-by-3 matrix row by row:
 * 0.15 0.875 0.375
 * 0.55 0.005 0.225
 * 0.30 0.12 0.4
 * It is a Markov matrix
 * Enter a 3-by-3 matrix row by row:
 * 0.95 -0.875 0.375
 * 0.65 0.005 0.225
 * 0.30 0.22 -0.4
 * It is not a Markov matrix
