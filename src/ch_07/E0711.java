/**
 * *7.11 (Statistics: compute deviation) Programming Exercise 5.45 computes the standard deviation of numbers. This exercise uses a different but equivalent formula to
 * compute the standard deviation of n numbers.
 * <p>
 * Enter ten numbers: 1.9 2.5 3.7 2 1 6 3 4 5 2
 * The mean is 3.11
 * The standard deviation is 1.55738
 * To compute the standard deviation with this formula, you have to store the individual numbers using an array, so that they can be used after the mean is obtained.
 * Your program should contain the following methods:
 * /** Compute the deviation of double values
 * <p>
 * public static double deviation(double[]x)
 * /** Compute the mean of an array of double values
 * public static double mean(double[]x)
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter ten numbers and displays the
 * mean and standard deviation,as shown in the following sample run:
