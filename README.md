I am sharing my solutions to the practice problems in
Y Daniel Liangs "Intro To Java Programming" in order to 
help guide other students understanding of the basics of
core java programming. There are no single correct anwsers
to these exercises. So while these programs do satisfy the REVEL
exercise check tool; They are by no means the only solutions to these 
problems and I encourage anyone reading them to try to find new or different 
methods of approaching these same problems.
